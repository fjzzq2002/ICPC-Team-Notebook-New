$w=(\lfloor\frac{c}{4}\rfloor-2c+y+\lfloor\frac{y}{4}\rfloor+\lfloor\frac{13(m+1)}{5}\rfloor+d-1)\bmod 7$\par
$w$: $0$ sunday, $1$ monday, $2$ tuesday, $6$ saturday. $c$: first two digits of year. $y$: last two digits of year. $m$: month where $3\le m\le 14$: change mon $1,2$ to mon $13,14$ in the previous year! $d$: day. Modular result may be negative.
